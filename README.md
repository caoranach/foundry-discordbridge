# Foundry ==> Discord Bridge
This module will, when set up correctly, automatically post messages from Foundry into Discord, with character portaits and names. It even has a way to search by author, despite webhooks typically disabling this functionality.

The Foundry Discordbot is to be used with the Foundry Discordbridge module, and must be configured before setting up.
## Required Setup
 - Add the module to FoundryVTT.
 - Prepare the bot in the bot folder.
 - You will need python3 installed. I suggest pyenv. You will also need to install libffi-dev. on Ubunto you can use apt-get install libffi-dev. !!!IMPORANT!!! if you have installed/setup python3 in pyenv BEFORE installing libffi-dev you will need to re-install python 3 in pyenv to use this new libffi. You may also need to run ldconfig prior.
 - Install the required modules from requirements.txt. Use pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 - Create a config.json based on exampleConfig.json
 - Ensure that the port and IP selected can be viewed by the FoundryVTT server. This is relative to websockets, so localhost won't work. Also, if you are using https, you will need to configure your nginx/apache reverse proxy to use the bot, as websockets will NOT allow you to mix https and http.
 - Configure the bot's token.
- Invite it to the guild you want it to use.
- Configure the module settings to tell Foundry where the bot is located.
- Create a campaign in the channel (see usage). IT HAS to match the name of the world you already created.
## Usage
Quotes are mandatory on arguments that are wrapped in them in these examples. Only the owner can configure Campaigns and delete messages. /me and non-whispered chat will be bridged automatically.
- Use the command `>_rpb campaign add "Title of your World in FoundryVTT"` in the channel you want messages bridged to.
- Use the command `>_rpb campaign move "Title"` to move a world's chat bridge.
- Messages will be automatically bridged when the module is Enabled in its settings, to avoid GM preparation leaking.
- To search messages by author use `>_rpb "campaign" "author" search terms` .
- To delete messages use `>_rpb message_id` to remove it from the search results as well.
- To delete campaigns use `>_rpb campaign delete "Title"` to disable the bridge and wipe the search log.
### Best Practices
- Don't use too much HTML in your chat, the translator to markdown is not perfect.
- Set player avatars to set avatars for the Discord bridge to use for OOC.
- Force Name Search should be on if Theatre Inserts is being used.
- Edit the CORS policy in the bot's code to increase security.
- Use a virtual environment to prepare the bot.
- If you're editing a cog, you can use the reload command to update it without having to restart the bot.

### Possible Future Plans
 - Method to run this without a bot? It would be possible, but I'm not sure how to yet.
 - Extensions to make the bot more useful; possibly "reversing" the direction and letting certain aspects be controlled from Discord.
